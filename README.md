# Hey, you. Yes, you 👋

If you're reading this, there's a good chance you're looking for someone who actually gets technology *and* people. Not one or the other. Both.

That's me. And honestly? It started with a screwdriver and a second-hand PC.

## 🎲 The Happy Accident

I built my first computer at 14. Spent my teenage years knee-deep in Linux, tinkering with things I probably shouldn't have, and absolutely loving every second of it.

But here's the thing about being a techie — I also just really liked people.

So when I landed a gig as a concession manager at Ralph Lauren, the unexpected happened. I fell in love with the art of sales. Customers came back. Not always to buy. Sometimes just to talk. And I realised that *this* — this ability to make people feel genuinely heard — was something I wanted to build a career on.

Turns out, pairing that with a lifelong obsession with technology was the best decision I ever made.

## 🔐 Why I Do This

That same energy has carried me through years in SaaS, Cloud, and Cybersecurity — building pipelines from the ground up, reversing churn, and helping people find solutions that actually move the needle.

There's one moment I keep coming back to when I think about why I love sales.

I worked with a CEO whose firm managed over €2 billion in AUM. He was living a nightmare. His PA was seconds away from wiring money to criminals — because the voice on the phone was his. Cloned from a YouTube video. Weaponised in minutes. And while that call was happening, attackers were already inside his inbox — reading, watching, quietly covering their tracks.

Someone had turned his face into a weapon against everything he'd built.

That evening, we sat down and made a plan. Within the week, we'd closed every door — 24/7 monitoring, airtight access controls, full visibility. No gaps. No way back in.

Weeks later, he told me he'd finally had a good night's sleep.

That's my favourite part of the job.

## 🧭 My North Star

Joe Girard — Guinness World Record holder for the world's greatest salesman — built his entire career on one principle: people buy from people they trust.

The funny thing is, I was living that truth before I ever knew his name.

I've turned down sales that weren't the right fit. Pointed people elsewhere. And they always come back — because trust compounds. Good salespeople sell technology. Great salespeople sell outcomes: better sleep, safer businesses, ambitions finally realised.

Integrity isn't a strategy. It's just who I am.

The inner 14-year-old who took apart computers just to see how they worked means I can go deep on the technical detail. But the person who spent years building relationships on a shop floor means I never lose sight of what actually matters — the human on the other side of the table.

## 🏋️ The Bit That Makes Me, Me

When I'm not in front of a client, you'll probably find me at a local run club — doing my best to negotiate with my runner's knee (results: mixed). Seventeen-year amateur bodybuilder. Arsenal supporter for longer than I'd like to admit. And someone who genuinely believes the discipline you build outside work shows up in everything you do inside it.

## ☁️ What I Do & What's Next

I'm an Account Director with a track record across new business development, strategic account management, cloud transformation, and managed services. Most recently I was a Business Development Manager at Thrive, working with hospitality and leisure organisations to shape their technology strategy and genuinely move the needle on business performance.

After that? A season of intentional wandering through Southeast Asia. Sometimes the best thing you can do for your career is step away from it for a while — to come back sharper, clearer, and ready.

And ready I am. I'm looking for my next chapter — a product I can genuinely believe in, in a sector where the technology actually matters: Cloud, Cybersecurity, SaaS, or Managed Services. The kind of role where I'm hunting new business, building long-term relationships, and selling outcomes that make a real difference to the people on the other side of the table.

If you need someone who brings:

| | |
|---|---|
| 💛 **Warmth** | People buy from people they trust |
| 🎯 **Results** | Top performing, quota-beating, relationship-driven |
| 🤝 **Integrity** | I'll tell you if it's not the right fit. Always |

...I'd love to grab a coffee and hear what you're building. Seriously. Reach out. I don't bite 😊
